# Program to find remainder of the multiplication product divided by n.
# Items in the array are multiplied one after another and divided by some number n. Find the reminder.

# solution:-
# def reminder_producer(arr, n):
#     product = 1
#     for x in arr:
#         product = product * x
#     return product % n

# list1 = [100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14]

# print(reminder_producer(list1, 11))
