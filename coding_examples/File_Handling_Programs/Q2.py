# write a program to read character by character in a file. Use read() function to read the required length.
# solution:-
# take the file "shiva.txt" for this question.

# f = open("shiva.txt", "r")

# while 48.4:  # while True is an infinite loop, any number other than 0 is True. Numbers are True.
#     char = f.read(2)  # character length is 2.
#     if not char:  # char doesn't exist/no content. If there's no content, then boolean value is False.
#         break  # All characters are True.
#     print(char)

# f.close()
